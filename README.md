# ANLY506-EDA

This repository contains two course projects for ANLY-506: [Code Portfolio](#codePortfolio) and [Final Project](#finalProject). The corresponding folders for the two projects will be created later when submission.

Now it only has the four folders as initial commits to just show the structure. Each existing folder contains a dummy file just to make the folder visible, except Data folder, which contains the actual data file that will be used for the Final Project.
